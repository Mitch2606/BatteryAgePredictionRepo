Hello, here is a small tutorial on ettiquitte when using a github repo. 

1 - NEVER work on the same branch
	Ex. If you want to add a feature. Create a new branch (ctrl+shift+N) and name it according to what the feature is.
	Ex. I want a function to normalize the data. I'd create a new branch named "Normalize-Data-Function"

2 - NEVER Commit to main

3 - Try to Commit is present tense
	Ex. I just updated the code to loop three times instead of four. The Commit title would be "Update LoopFile to three Loops"

4 - Submit a Pull Request when you are done working on a branch. If there are merge conflicts please notify the team.
